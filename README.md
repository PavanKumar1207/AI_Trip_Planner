## 🧭 Introduction  

**Gen AI-driven Itinerary Planner** is an advanced **AI-powered travel assistant** designed to make trip planning effortless, efficient, and personalized.  

Traditional travel planning demands hours of research and constant adjustments due to flight changes, weather, or event schedules. This intelligent system simplifies that entire process through **automation and real-time adaptability**.  

Powered by **Python** and **FastAPI**, the planner delivers secure authentication, seamless connectivity, and scalable deployment on **AWS Cloud**.  

Users can provide preferences such as:  
- 🌆 Destination  
- 💰 Budget  
- 📅 Travel Dates  
- 🎯 Interests (Adventure, Culture, Relaxation, etc.)  

The system then generates a **customized travel itinerary**, intelligently optimized for time, cost, and experience.

## 💡 Key Features  

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Personalization:**  
  Understands user intent and generates tailored travel itineraries using natural language queries.  

- 💬 **Conversational Planning (NLP):**  
  Users can simply say, *“Plan a seven-day trip to Italy,”* and receive a detailed itinerary instantly.  

- ⚡ **Real-Time Adaptability:**  
  Automatically updates itineraries for **flight delays, weather changes, or local events**, ensuring smooth travel experiences.  

- 🔒 **Secure Authentication:**  
  Implements **OAuth 2.0** for secure user access and data protection.  

- ☁️ **Cloud Hosting (AWS):**  
  Ensures scalability, performance, and data reliability through cloud infrastructure.  

- 🔄 **Integration Support:**  
  Modular architecture supports easy integration with **existing travel management systems** or **corporate travel dashboards**.
